# SecProject
Welcome to Raf!  The primary goals are to create a visually appealing interface, ensure easy navigation, and provide a smooth purchasing process for users. 
My design process began with detailed wireframes and mockups created in Figma. These visual guides serve as blueprints for our project, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly interface.

Once the project is up and running, you can access it via : https://www.figma.com/design/ypyWoQRI7nWYQdr9MuEVxj/Second-Project?node-id=5-2&t=0qSfB3FOb8qImIEW-1
